## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **comprehensive credit risk analysis for Nova Bank**, built in **Power BI**.  
The aim is to help the bank **identify risky borrowers, improve lending policies, and minimize default rates** while keeping loans fair and accessible.  

The dashboards transform raw loan data into **actionable insights** through clear KPIs, interactive slicers, and storytelling visuals.  

---

## 🎯 Business Questions Answered
The dashboards are designed to answer **real-world banking questions**:

1. **Which groups of borrowers are more or less likely to default?**  
   → Analyzed by employment type, home ownership, loan grade, age, and past defaults.  

2. **What factors matter most in predicting loan outcomes?**  
   → Explored through debt-to-income ratio, loan size, loan purpose, and interest rate.  

3. **How do loan size, income, interest rates, and repayment terms affect risk?**  
   → Visuals compare loan amount vs income, interest rate by loan grade, and default vs term length.  

4. **Can early signs of financial trouble be spotted?**  
   → Borrowers with high DTI, past defaults, or unstable employment show early warning signals.  

5. **How should Nova Bank adjust lending policies to be safer and fairer?**  
   → Insights show stricter lending policies are needed for certain loan grades, purposes, and DTI bands.

**Key Features:**
- KPIs: Avg Debt-Income Ratio, % Borrowers with Past Defaults, % Self-Employed, % Homeowners.  
- Default Rate by Employment Type → Unemployed borrowers have the highest default risk.  
- Default Rate by Home Ownership → Renters default more than homeowners.  
- Default Rate by Past Defaults → Borrowers with prior defaults are very high risk.  
- Default Rate by DTI Buckets → Risk grows as DTI increases.

---

## 📊 Overall Findings
- **Risky Borrowers:** Unemployed, renters, older borrowers (65+), high DTI (>60%), and those with past defaults.  
- **Risky Loan Types:** Personal and home improvement loans show the highest default rates.
